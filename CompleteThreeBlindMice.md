Three Small Mice  
Three Small Mice  
Three Small Mice  
Pined for some fun  
Pined for some fun  
Pined for some fun  
They made up their minds to set out to roam ;  
Said they, “’Tis dull to remain at home,”  
And all the luggage they took was a comb,  
These three Small Mice    
  
  
Three Bold Mice  
Three Bold Mice  
Came to an Inn  
Came to an Inn  
Came to an Inn  
“Good evening, Host, can you give us a bed?”  
But the Host he grinned and he shook his head;  
So they all slept out in a field instead,  
These three Bold Mice.  
  
  
Three Cold Mice  
Three Cold Mice  
Woke up next morn  
Woke up next morn  
Woke up next morn  
They each had a cold and a swollen face,  
Through sleeping all night in an open space;  
So they rose quite early and left the place,  
These three Cold Mice.  
  
  
Three Hungry Mice  
Three Hungry Mice  
Searched for some food  
Searched for some food  
Searched for some food  
But all they found was a walnut shell  
That lay by the side of a dried-up well;  
Who had eaten the nut they could not tell,  
These three Hungry Mice.  
  
  
Three Starved Mice  
Three Starved Mice  
Came to a Farm  
Came to a Farm  
Came to a Farm  
The Farmer was eating some bread and cheese;  
So they all went down on their hands and knees,  
And squeaked, “Pray, give us a morsel, please,”  
These three Starved Mice.  
  
  
Three Glad Mice  
Three Glad Mice  
Ate all they could  
Ate all they could  
Ate all they could  
They felt so happy they danced with glee;  
But the Farmer’s Wife came in to see  
What might this merry-making be  
Of three Glad Mice.  
  
  
Three Poor Mice  
Three Poor Mice  
Soon changed their tone  
Soon changed their tone  
Soon changed their tone  
The Farmer’s Wife said, "What are you at,  
And why were you capering round like that?  
Just wait a minute: I’ll fetch the Cat"  
Oh dear! Poor Mice.  
  
  
Three Scared Mice  
Three Scared Mice  
Ran for their lives  
Ran for their lives  
Ran for their lives   
They jumped out on to the window ledge;  
The mention of “Cat” set their teeth on edge;  
So they hid themselves in the bramble hedge,  
These three Scared Mice.  
  
  
Three Sad Mice  
Three Sad Mice  
What could they do?  
What could they do?  
What could they do?  
The bramble hedge was most unkind:  
It scratched their eyes and made them blind,  
And soon each Mouse went out of his mind,  
These three Sad Mice.  
  
  
Three Blind Mice  
Three Blind Mice  
See how they run  
See how they run  
See how they run  
They all ran after the Farmer’s Wife,  
Who cut off their tails with the carving knife.  
Did you ever see such a sight in your life  
As three Blind Mice?  
  
  
Three Sick Mice  
Three Sick Mice  
Gave way to tears  
Gave way to tears  
Gave way to tears  
They could not see and they had no end;  
They sought a Chemist and found a Friend  
He gave them some “Never too late to mend,”  
These Three Sick Mice.  
  
  
Three Wise Mice  
Three Wise Mice  
Rubbed rubbed away  
Rubbed rubbed away  
Rubbed rubbed away  
And soon their tails began to grow,  
And their eyes recovered their sight, you know;  
They looked in the glass and it told them so.  
These three Wise Mice.  
  
  
Three Proud Mice  
Three Proud Mice  
Soon settled down  
Soon settled down  
Soon settled down 	  
The name of their house I cannot tell,  
But they’ve learnt a trade and are doing well.  
If you call upon them, ring the bell  
Three times twice.
